	<h2>What is DMCA?</h2>
    <p>Twitch is live streaming platform that was founded in 2011. Many forms of live streaming content can be found on the site such as video game content, cooking, music performances, podcast, travel live streams, etc.  The main attraction to the site is video games since the site started as Justin.tv which was primairly for video game contnat. Twitch became so popular that justin.tv changed its name to Twitch.tv and in 2014 Amazon acquired Twitch. </p>
    <h2>How does it effect Twitch and its content creators on its service?</h2>
    <p>Twitch is a platform where I am able to watch some of my favorite content creators and channels that do things such as 3d model, cook, play video games, or esports events live as well as interact with the creators themselves thyrough a live chat as well as interact with the chat.</p>
