                <h2>How does censorship take place on Twitch?</h2>
                <p>Twitch is a platform that is broadcast around the world, because of that they have rules for both streamers and users to follow. With Twitch Terms Of Service they have many rules for streamers and users to follow. </p>

                <h2>Have any twitch streamers left the platform because of Twitch TOS?</h2>
                <p>There have been many twitch streamers over the years that have been banned, because of the recent DMCA strikes as of December 3rd over 50 twitch streamers have been banned. Many of the streamers that were banned redently were due to the
                    recent DMCA take down due to many instances where a streamer would be plaing a video game with copy written music, but other bans can be due to things such as sexism, racism, nudity, and other actions that violate Twitch TOS. Depending
                    on how severe the action is that breaks Twitch TOS determines how long a streamer can get banned, it can be a few days, a few weeks, a few months, and in some cases permanent.</p>
